<p>The student teacher relationship is based on trust and respect. It is a teacher's job to
<b><i>create an atmosphere of trust and respect in the classroom</i></b>. For this the teacher
should <b><i>make sure</i></b> that:

    <td valign="top" width="100%">     They should feel that the teacher knows the subject he is there to teach. This calls for <b><i>going
            to class well prepared</i></b>. In my opinion even the homework assignments should be well thought out

            important yet simple problems. In grading these quizzes the teacher should point out the errors
			and give partial credit when a student gets a part of a problem right. (<b><i>The teacher should point
			out to the students that these problems are about points that should be at their fingertips. It
			has always helped to let them redo their quizzes.</i></b>) Students trained by those quizzes would
			inevitably do better in other tests. At higher levels, if the number of students is small,

           The nature of Mathematics is such that a number of future courses depend on what the students
		   learn today. So the teacher <b><i>should mention the subjects where this knowledge will apply</i></b>. If it
		   is a graduate level course the teacher should allude to the fields of research where the
		   techniques of the current course apply.<!--msimagelist--></td>

<p>     This much about what the students should know. Here is what they may not be told but a teacher should keep in mind.
	 The most important job of a teacher is to train the student to read and think independently. This is hard but not
	 impossible. I normally give them reading assignments which, at lower levels, are nothing but "read and copy"
     in the beginning and then "read and solve a given problem".
