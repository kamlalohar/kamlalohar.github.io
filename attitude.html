My general attitude towards research is best described by saying that I chase patterns.
When I see a good result I want to know what is happening behind the scenes that
causes this result and once I find the facts that caused the beautiful result I indicate how
else those facts can be used. Most of my papers are good examples of that but my
work on Nagata like theorems and on Kaplansky like theorems stands out. Here
Nagata like Theorems are statements that generalize Nagata's theorem on UFD's: Let
R be an integral domain that satisfies ACC on principal ideals, and let S be a
multiplicative set generated by primes of R,. If  is a UFD then so is R. Next, the theorem
of Kaplansky that I targeted is: An integral domain R is a UFD if and only if, every
nonzero prime ideal of R contains a nonzero principal prime. I have singled out these
two theorems because I was so impressed by them that I actually went chasing their
patterns into partially ordered groups (not necessarily abelian) and came up with some
interesting results.
