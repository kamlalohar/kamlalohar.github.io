<p><b>Textbook</b>: <b>James Stewart, Calculus, 4<sup>th</sup> Edition,
Brooks/Cole Publishing Co., 1999</b>.</p>

<p><b>Course prerequisites</b>: Satisfactory completion of Math 147 or its
equivalent.</p>

<p><b>Syllabus: </b>We will cover Chapters 1 through 6 of the textbook.</p>

<p><b>Course Description: </b>This is the first part of a three-semester course in
calculus. The emphasis of this course is on applications in Physical Sciences
and Engineering, but we will also investigate models from Life Sciences and
Business where calculus has proved its worth. In Calculus I, we will cover Chapters
1-6 of the above- mentioned textbook. Of these, Chapter 1 is essentially a
review and will be covered somewhat quickly. The remaining chapters will be
covered in detail.</p>

<p><b>Course objectives</b>: On a successful completion of this course the
student should</p>

<p>1. Understand the meanings of
the terms: function, limit of a function, derivative, differentiable,
indefinite integral and definite integral.</p>

<p>2. Be able to find the
derivatives, using standard methods, of common differentiable functions. Be
able to find the value of the derivative of a function for a given value of the
variable and be able to interpret it for practical and theoretical
applications.</p>

<p>3.Know the indefinite
integration as the reverse process of differentiation and the definite integral
as a sum.</p>

<p>4. Know the standard tools
that help in finding an indefinite integral and the various applications of
integration.</p>

<p>5. Be able to recognize the
situations in the real world where his/her knowledge of differentiation and
integration applies and be able to apply it independently.</p>

<p><b>Homework</b>: Homework will be assigned at the end of each section
but will not be collected.</p>

<p><b>Calculators:</b> You are permitted (in fact encouraged) to use
programmable graphing calculators, but laptops or other devices with QWERTY keyboards
are not be allowed.</p>

<p align=left style='text-align:left'><b>Math Help: Math Lab</b> (<b>Museum Building (Top Floor)</b>) is a free drop-in tutorial
service staffed by Teaching Assistants and Instructors from the Department of
Mathematics. The hours are:<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>      </span><b>To be
announced</b><span style='mso-tab-count:2'>                            
</span>.
The Math Lab provides one of the best ways of getting personalized help. (About
Math help: Remember that Mathematics is not a spectator sport. You would not
get it if you do not participate. So get your hands dirty, try to do the
problems yourself and seek help only if you have some real difficulty with a
problem or a concept.)</p>

<p><b>Tests, quizzes and grading</b>: There will be:</p>

<p style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;
tab-stops:list .25in'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><b>Three in-class<span

</span><b>A comprehensive final</b> (<b>Tuesday 12-12-2000, 8:00- 10:00 PM)</b>. In
addition</p>

tab-stops:list .25in'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><b>There will be some 6
to 8 quizzes</b>. The quizzes will not be
announced. There will be a minimum of 6 quizzes to be taken. If you do take
more, the highest scoring six will be taken into account.</p>

<p style='margin-left:.25in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;
tab-stops:list .25in'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>To make sure that you
read and understand some topics on your own I will give you some reading
assignments on some topics. The reading assignments will be due at the next
meeting.</p>

<p><b>Grades</b>: The allocation of grades will be as follows: 100
points each for the three in-class<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>tests, 50 points for the reading assignments, and 200 for the final. The
quizzes will be worth 150 points. In all you will be working for 700 points.
(There will be <b>no make-ups</b>. If you do have legitimate and documented
excuse for missing a test/quiz, your grade will be recalculated without that
test.)</p>

<p style='margin-left:3.0pt'><b>Grading
scale</b> will be approximately as in the
following table:</p>

<p align=left style='text-align:left'>(<b>Note</b>: I do reserve the right to give bonus points to those
whose performance in the class turns out to be outstanding. Being nice to me
will not help. You will have to show performance, by participating in
class-discussions, by asking questions and by getting good grades.)</p>

<p align=left style='text-align:left'><b>Changes in policies</b>: Course policies are subject to change. Any changes will be announced
in class. You are responsible for keeping track of any such announcements.</p>

<p align=left style='text-align:left'><b>Notes</b>: (1)
Past experience indicates that you will need at least 12 hours of study per
week, in addition to the 4 contact hours, if you want to get good grades in
this class. Try not to miss classes. It is not always possible to see the useful points
on your own.</p>

<p align=left style='text-align:left'>(2) Reading the textbook, as the course progresses, enhances the
understanding of the subject. Doing homework regularly also helps and
allocating some study time to prepare for tests also improves the grades.</p>

<p><b>Disabilities</b>: If you have or you believe you have a disability
that may require accommodation on the part of ISU, call 282-3599 to make an
appointment with Robert Campbell, Director of the Center for Students with
Disabilities.</p>

<p align=left style='text-align:left'><b>Academic Honesty</b>: You may work with other students on most assignments, but you are
expected to write your own solutions and reading assignments. There will be no
tolerance for cheating or plagiarism. University policies will be enforced in
such cases.</p>
