Dear Tiberiu,
After I wrote the somewhat brisk e-mail to you I sat down and wrote what =
we should put in the corrigendum. Here's what I have. Please read it to =
see if it is OK.=20

        Dear Muhammad,

        I thank you for your email. My father is an active man. He found =
a refuge in doing a lot of things over the day (going to my mother's =
grave, trying to fulfill her past wishes etc). Now I try to go at least =
once a week to visit him (there are about 65 Km between us).

        About that proof, it is also my fault I did not see that gap.=20

        Sincerely,
        Tiberiu

          Dear Tiberiu,
          How is your father now. I am working on the p.o. group version =
of our paper (characterizing domains of finite star character) when I =
realized that I overlooked something while using Zorn's lemma in the =
proof of Theorem 1. I think in line 8 of the proof we must have: Let S =
be the family of sets of mutually co-maximal homogeneous members of =
gamma.
          We can rework the proof and write a corrigendum.
          Sincerely,
          Muhammad

                  Dear Muhammad,

                  I thank you for this advice. I kept him company these =
days and now I came to take my wife to spend the Easter at my father's =

                  I wish you good health and peace of heart.

                    I hope and pray that your father soon overcomes his =

                            I thank you for your supporting words.

                            I did not except at all that my mother will =

day on Saturday and at dinner time her heart stopped.

Corrigendum for "Characterizing domains of finite $\ast $-character"

Tiberiu Dumitrescu and Muhammad Zafrullah

\bigskip
\end{center}

There is some confusion in lines 8-15 of the proof of Theorem 1. In the
following we offer a fix to clear the confusion and give a rationale for =
the
fix.

The fix: Read the proof from the sentence that starts from line 8 as =
follows:

Let $S$ be the family of sets of mutually $\ast $-comaximal homogeneous
members of $\Gamma $ containing $I$. Then $S$ is nonempty by $(\sharp =
\sharp
).$ Obviously $S$ is partially ordered under inclusion. Let $%
A_{n_{1}}\subset A_{n_{2}}\subset ...\subset A_{n_{r}}\subset ...$ be an
ascending chain of sets in $S$. Consider $T=3D\cup A_{n_{r}}.$ We claim =
that
the members of $T$ are mutually $\ast $-comaximal. For take $x,y\in T,$ =
then=20
$x,y\in A_{n_{i}},$ for some $i,$ and hence are $\ast $-comaximal. =
Having
established this we note that by $(\sharp ),$ $T$ must be finite and =
hence
must be equal to one of the $A_{n_{j}}.$ Thus by Zorn's Lemma, $S$ must =
have
a maximal element $U=3D\{V_{1},V_{2},...,V_{n}\}.$ Disregard the next =
two
sentences and read on from: Next let $M_{i}$ be the maximal $\ast =
$-ideal....

Rationale for the Fix: Using sets of mutually $\ast $-comaximal elements
would entail some unwanted maximal elements as the following example =
shows:
Let $x=3D2^{2}5^{2}$ in $Z$ the ring of integers. Then $\mathcal{S}%
=3D\{\{(2^{2}5^{2})\},\{(25^{2})\},\{(2^{2}5)\}\{(2^{2})\},$ $%
\{(5^{2})\},\{(2^{2}),(5^{2})\},$ $\{(2)\},\{(5)\},$ $\{(2),(5^{2})\},%
\{(2^{2}),(5)\},$ $\{(2),(5)\}\}.$ In this case, while $\mathcal{S}$
includes legitimate maximal elements: $\{(2^{2}),(5^{2})\},$ $%
\{(2),(5^{2})\},$ $\{(2^{2}),(5)\},\{(2),(5)\}$ it also includes $%
\{(2^{2}5^{2})\},\{(25^{2})\},\{(2^{2}5)\}$ which fit the definition of
maximal elements. The reason why the fix should work is that given any =
set $%
T=3D\{A_{1},A_{2},...,A_{m}\}$ of mutually $\ast $-comaximal $\ast =
$-finite
ideals, by $(\sharp \sharp )$ there is a set of mutually $\ast =
$-comaximal
homogeneous $\ast $-finite ideals $\{H_{1},H_{2},...,H_{n}\}$ in $\Gamma =
,$
where $n\geq m$ such that each $H_{j}$ contains some $A_{i}.$ Also as a
homogeneous ideal cannot be contained in two disjoint ideals we do not =
face
the above indicated problem and Zorn's Lemma gives the required maximal
elements.
