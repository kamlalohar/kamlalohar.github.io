First of all plz rename your Inpage.exe to Example.exe

Softkey Users: If you possess InPage Professional version with Softkey protection 
then when you launch InPage for the first time after installation, you 
will be prompted with the License Configuration dialog. Here you will 
need to carry out the following steps-

1.	Copy the Site Code by first selecting it with the help of a mouse.
2.	Use Control-C to copy the selected code into clipboard.
3.	Paste the site code into an e-mail and send this e-mail to ez007@mail.com
4.	On receipt of your e-mail, a valid Site Key will be e-mailed back to you within 
	one to two days. 
5.	You will need to enter this Site Key and click on Validate button. 
6.	Once validated, InPage will be configured to run on this particular machine 
	without asking for the Site Key again.

Usually for subsequent launches, you will be prompted with a "Configure License" 
dialog. If you wish to transfer the license to a different machine then this
is the time to press Enter. On the other hand if you wish to continue
using InPage on this machine just wait and InPage will be launched.


Cautions:
DO NOT attempt to move the program once it's installed without using the 'transfer license' option from the file menu. 
DO NOT change the date backwards in time. 
DO NOT erase any hidden files in the bin directory. 
DO NOT uninstall if you plan on using the program again.
DO NOT run Norton Utilities Speed Disk without changing the settings: 
DO NOT convert from a Win95 machine with FAT16 to a Win98 machine with FAT32
