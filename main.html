<p>Welcome, to the web site
you may end up building for me and here's how you can help. I usually
have a lot of interesting ideas but often no strength at all to see them
through. So, I share them with others. I have found it useful, especially
during the years when I was sick and living a nomadic life. During that
period I was publishing Mathematical papers in good journals so regularly
that a lot of people did not even notice my absence from the academe. Thanks
to my collaborators, the angels of mercy, who, put in a lot of work to
see what I was trying to do, added their ideas and made the work sufficiently
presentable. May God bless them all. Now what do I
want? More than want, I "need" your help in the following areas:
