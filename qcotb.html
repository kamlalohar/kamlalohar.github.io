<p>Books, you might agree, have played a significant role in the intellectual, spiritual and
material advancement of humanity. Our usual attitude towards the books is, "if it is in a
book it must be correct". But, recently, I have come across some textbooks, in
Mathematics, that have printing errors, and in some cases false statements. Errors in
the first edition, I agree, are unavoidable, but if printing errors and/or false statements
stay around until the fourth edition then there is some cause for concern. Now usually
the best thing is to write to the author or to the publisher, but it may not be easy to track
the right person to write to.
 <p>If you have seen an error of any kind in a textbook, and in the beginning we shall restrict
it only to (recently published) Mathematics textbooks, write to me at <a href="mailto:qcotb@yahoo.com?subject=Reporting an error found in a Text Book" target="_self">qcotb@usa.net</a>
 giving the title, author, publisher and date of publication of the book and
of course the page and line numbers where the error occurs. To save my time spent in
locating the book, please send me a photo-copy of the offending page/pages at my
postal address which is available at the bottom.
<p>On receiving your e-mail I will include the contents under the <a href="currentsubmissions.html" title="Current Submissions" target="Main">Current Submission</a> link,
and if possible I will send a copy of it to the author. Now it may happen that the author,
or someone browsing the web page, has some suitable explanation of what you
thought was an error. To save you the embarrassment, your input will appear initially
anonymous. When I receive word from the author, or from an expert, saying, " yes, that
was an error", I will include your name and address with your message. In this case this
message will stay on display until I get a written assurance from the publishers that the
error is corrected and sufficiently publicized.
<p>You can use this <a href="generalpdf/qcotb.pdf" title="Letter" target="_self">
pre-formatted letter</a> to write to me. Feel free to print and use it.

<p>Just to give you an idea, here is an <a href="generalpdf/exqcotb.pdf" title="Example" target="_self">example</a>. This would also give you an idea of how to
send in the errors you caught.

<p>Sometimes, a textbook is written (or gets written) in such a way that it is
hard to understand what it is saying. The result is confusion and a lot of
students who read from it fail. I came across such a book. You may read<a href="StatsbookF2.pdf">
my
review of this book </a>by clicking at the highlighted part of this sentence. It
so happens that this book came recommended for limiting the number of passes in
a basic Statistics course. Why should a chairman of a Mathematics Department be
looking for such a book? I see good but ugly economic reasons behind this quest
for unreadable books. But this is not the place for discussing those reasons. I
might write about it if time permits. IF YOU COME ACROSS A COURSE THAT IS BEING
USED AS A WEED OUT COURSE DO WRITE TO ME at <a href="mailto:mzafrullah@usa.net">mzafrullah@usa.net</a>&nbsp;
I will put your letter on display on my web page.
